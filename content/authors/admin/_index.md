Our lab focuses on applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to systematically characterize key genotypes, molecular phenotypes, and clinical phenotypes within the tumor microenvironment. Through a systems biology approach, we aim to uncover the relationships among these factors to advance precision oncology. Here are our main research directions: 
1. Characterization and prediction of key molecular phenotypes; 
2. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment; 
3. Inference of associations between genotype, molecular phenotype and clinical phenotype.

We are looking to recruit postdoctoral fellow, Ph.D. student, and Masterâ€™s student from bioinformatics, computational biology, and mathematics, as well as several interns. If you are interested, please send your resume to binduan@sjtu.edu.cn.
