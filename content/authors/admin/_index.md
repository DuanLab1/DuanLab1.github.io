Our group is in its early stages, with ample funding available. We are looking to recruit one postdoctoral fellow, one Ph.D. student, and one Master's student each from the fields of bioinformatics, computer science, and mathematics, as well as several interns. 

The group will offer generous performance-based rewards and a research environment that is equal, harmonious, and fosters a mentor-mentee relationship. The group leader will be actively engaged in scientific research and welcomes young talents who share the same passion, are quick-thinking, and have a love for the field to join us. Together, we will conduct high-fun, high-value, and high-level scientific research on cancer!

If you are interested, please send your resume to bioinfo_db@163.com. Those who pass the initial screening will be invited to participate in an online or in-person interview.
