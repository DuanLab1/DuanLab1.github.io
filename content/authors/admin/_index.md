our team try to tackle the most fundamental scientific questions in cancer research from first principles using computational and systems biology approaches, thereby aiding in the development of the next generation of precision cancer therapies.

We are looking to recruit postdoctoral fellow, Ph.D. student, and Master's student from bioinformatics, computational biology, and mathematics, as well as several interns. If you are interested, please send your resume to bioinfo_db@163.com. Those who pass the initial screening will be invited to participate in an online or in-person interview.
