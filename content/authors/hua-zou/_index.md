My primary research interest lies in the correlation between metagenomics and host health, particularly the interaction between tumor immunotherapy and gut microbiota. Additionally, I am deeply interested in the development of algorithms for the analysis of multi-omics data. Furthermore, I am keen on exploring the application of machine learning in the field of bioinformatics.
