abstract: With the rapid advancements in spatial transcriptome sequencing, multiple tissue slices are now available, enabling the integration and interpretation of spatial cellular landscapes. Herein, we introduce SpaDo, a tool for multi-slice spatial domain analysis, including modules for multi-slice spatial domain detection, reference-based annotation, and multiple slice clustering at both single-cell and spot resolutions. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We demonstrate SpaDo’s effectiveness with over 40 multi-slice spatial transcriptome datasets from 7 sequencing platforms. Our findings highlight SpaDo’s potential to reveal novel biological insights in multi-slice spatial transcriptomes.
