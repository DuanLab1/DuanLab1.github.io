title: "Exploring morphological heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells: machine learning-based approach for cell identification and prognostic implications"

abstract: "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), arising from the spread of primary or metastatic tumors, are crucial in understanding tumor metastasis. Unlike traditional serum biomarkers, CTCs, being actual tumor cells, offer more direct insight into the specific tumor's biology."

summary: "In conclusion, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the morphological features and heterogeneity of CTCs across a variety of cancer types, with a primary focus on HCC due to its predominance in our dataset. The ML-based model for CTC recognition developed here could significantly enhance the accuracy and feasibility of CTC analysis in the clinical setting. "
